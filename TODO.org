* DONE list/search events
* TODO diagnose events failing to parse

will need to modify the event to ICS code to retain fields we don't use
* TODO [[https://github.com/robur-coop/icalendar/pull/13][handle RECURRENCE-ID]]

Currently, you can use [[https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer][vdirsyncer]]
* TODO support a DSL of date queries (e.g. query for every event on a Monday)
* TODO support querying times as well as dates
* TODO custom date/time formatting
* TODO support querying regex
